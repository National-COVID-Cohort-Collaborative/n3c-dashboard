	<p><strong>Sample:</strong> All patients in the N3C Data Enclave who have Metformin indicated in their EHR. 
	Medication exposure data shown here does not mean the patient actually took the displayed medication.

	specify In-patient administration. There is no guarantee that a patient was exposed to the displayed medications, 
	only that their medical records include evidence of that medication.
